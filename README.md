* Create an Brewery Collection by using <a href="https://www.openbrewerydb.org/documentation/01-listbreweries"> Brewery API  </a> using ReactJS
* Buttons that can redirect user into a details page of a Brewery Collection
* A searchbar that can search by any of the available data inside the api.

## Technologies:

- ReactJS
- TypeScript
- Bootstrap 5
- React Router Dom 6
- Axios
- Custom Hook

## Future Improvement:

Styling of the application is very simple, the app can have more detail in styling.

If user want to reduce HTTP request, the app should store Brewery Details Info in global state (redux, useConetxt) and use it for Detail Page instead of fetching new HTTP request everytime.

Searchbar can be customize to search by many other query (City, State, Country...)
